## Technology Stack

The following technologies are used for this website:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)

Vite is used to for the creation of the project and for increased build speeds.
TypeScript is used to add static typing to the project.
SCSS is used to make writing CSS easier and more efficient.

All three of the above technologies still work for normal JS and CSS files but add extra functionality when used with their respective file types.

## File Structure

All of the code for the website is within the `src` folder apart from `index.html` which can be used to change meta data for the website such as the browser icon or name. 

The `main.tsx` file should not be changed. 

The `App.tsx` file contains the main structure for the application. 

## Running and Building the Website

To run and build the website, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
4. To run the website locally, use the command `npm run dev`.
5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the website.
6. To build the website for production, use the command `npm run build`.
7. The built files will be located in the `build` directory.

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine before proceeding with the above steps.
